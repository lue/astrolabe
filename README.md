This is a collection of lessons for the course "Basic statistical analysis of Astronomical observations". See syllabus below...

# Basic statistical analysis of Astronomical observations #

## Course description and objectives ##

Almost any scientific research is based on analysis of observational data and comparing it with theoretic predictions. In this course we focus on the first part. The main objective of this course is to provide hands-on experience working with real astronomical data. We will explore a few major data formats, public catalogs, libraries and ways to work with them. Basic statistical approaches will be studied for extracting useful information from data.

The goals of this course is to become familiar with workflow of data processing. It is a necessary knowledge for either those who are going to pursue experimental career path or those who are going to do purely theoretical work.

In addition some time will be spent on making figures (publication quality) and visualization of data.

The course is fully adapted to be taught online.

## Requirements ##

Knowledge of basic astronomy and cosmology required. Any ASTRO 101 should be sufficient.
Experience with programming in any language. The language of choice in this course is Python, therefore all examples will be provided in it.

## Technical ##

Students are supposed to complete tasks on their own laptops with installed distribution of Python, or use online free services like Wakari. The latter one is preferable since functioning of all examples is guaranteed. In case of online teaching Wakari is strongly recommended.
Grading
15% – per project. Students are supposed to write short report with figures they plotted (5%). Also they have to provide working code (5% for reading the data; 5% for statistical analysis).
The remaining percents go to the final project, which is graded in the same manner.

## Lecture schedule ##

Class consists of series of projects (every two weeks) with one final project (3-4 weeks). Each project features three parts: a data type/format, an astrophysical effect, a statistical method. Optional projects are not necessary to complete the Final project, and can be included in case if more time available.

At the beginning of each project a lecture will be provided (or video, in case of online teaching), which will cover theory and new concepts. Then students will be required to follow the step-by-step instructions, which will help them to complete a significant amount of the project. Some part of the project will be left for their own research and only references to public resources will be provided, in order to facilitate self learning.
